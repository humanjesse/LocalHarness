## Commit Message Guidelines

### Format
```
<type>: <short description>

[optional longer description]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no functionality change)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config)

### Examples

**Good commits:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve crash when terminal resizes during streaming"
git commit -m "docs: update README with macOS installation instructions"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify markdown table rendering logic"
```

**Bad commits (avoid these):**
```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "wip"
git commit -m "more changes"
git commit -m "asdf"
```

### Multi-line Commits (for bigger changes)
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add emoji skin tone support

- Implement ZWJ sequence detection
- Add width calculation for modifiers
- Update getCharWidth function with new ranges
- Add tests for family emoji rendering"
```

## Semantic Versioning

ZodoLlama follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### Version Format: `vX.Y.Z`
- **MAJOR (X)**: Breaking changes (API changes, incompatible updates)
- **MINOR (Y)**: New features (backwards-compatible)
- **PATCH (Z)**: Bug fixes (backwards-compatible)

### Examples
- `v0.1.0` ‚Üí `v0.1.1`: Fixed a bug (PATCH)
- `v0.1.1` ‚Üí `v0.2.0`: Added new feature like table support (MINOR)
- `v0.2.0` ‚Üí `v1.0.0`: Major rewrite or breaking config change (MAJOR)

### Pre-1.0 Versions
- Before `v1.0.0`, the project is considered in development
- Breaking changes can happen in minor versions
- Example: `v0.1.0` ‚Üí `v0.2.0` might have breaking changes

### When to Increment

**PATCH (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1):**
- Fixed a crash
- Fixed rendering issue
- Performance improvements
- Small refactors

**MINOR (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0):**
- New markdown feature (e.g., code highlighting)
- New configuration option
- New keyboard shortcut
- Non-breaking improvements

**MAJOR (0.9.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0):**
- Config file format changes
- Removed features
- Changed default behavior significantly
- Command-line argument changes

## Creating Releases

### Step 1: Prepare the Release

1. **Ensure all changes are committed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   ```

2. **Update version in relevant files** (if applicable):
   - README.md (if version mentioned)
   - Any version constants in code

3. **Test the build:**
   ```bash
   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
   ./zig-out/bin/zodollama
   # Test major features to ensure they work
   ```

4. **Review recent changes:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   # Review commits since last release
   ```

### Step 2: Create and Push Tag

1. **Create annotated tag:**
   ```bash
   # Format: git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0 - Initial public release"
   ```

2. **Push the tag:**
   ```bash
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the Linux x86_64 binary
   - Generate checksums
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Attach the binary and checksums

### Step 3: Verify the Release

1. Go to: `https://github.com/humanjesse/zodollama/releases`
2. Check that the release was created
3. Verify the binary is attached
4. Download and test the binary

### Step 4: Edit Release Notes (Optional)

GitHub will auto-generate release notes, but you can enhance them:

1. Go to the release page
2. Click "Edit"
3. Add highlights:
   ```markdown
   ## Highlights
   - üéâ New feature: Table rendering support
   - üêõ Fixed crash during window resize
   - ‚ö° Improved markdown parsing performance by 30%

   ## Breaking Changes
   None

## GitHub Release Checklist

Use this checklist when creating a release:

- [ ] All changes committed and pushed to `main`
- [ ] Build succeeds locally: `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`
- [ ] Tested main features work correctly
- [ ] Version number decided (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- [ ] Created annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..."`
- [ ] Pushed tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Verified GitHub Actions workflow succeeded
- [ ] Downloaded and tested release binary
- [ ] Updated release notes with highlights (optional)
- [ ] Announced release (if applicable)

---

## Branch Strategy

### Simple Solo Developer Strategy

**For now (solo development):**
- Work directly on `main` branch
- Use good commit messages
- Tag releases when ready

**Advantages:**
- Simple and fast
- No overhead
- Works great for solo projects

### Advanced Strategy (Optional - for later)

When the project grows or you have contributors:

**Branches:**
- `main` - Stable, always deployable
- `develop` - Active development
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/syntax-highlighting

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add syntax highlighting for code blocks"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/syntax-highlighting

# When ready, merge to main via GitHub Pull Request
# (or locally: git checkout main && git merge feature/syntax-highlighting)
```

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bug Fix Release

```bash
# 1. Fix the bug
vim ui.zig
zig build && ./zig-out/bin/zodollama  # Test

# 2. Commit
git add ui.zig
git commit -m "fix: prevent crash when terminal width is very small"

# 3. Push
git push origin main

# 4. Create patch release
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Release v0.1.1 - Fix crash on small terminals"
git push origin v0.1.1
```

### Scenario 2: New Feature Release

```bash
# 1. Develop feature (might take multiple commits)
git commit -m "feat: add syntax highlighting for code blocks"
git commit -m "feat: support multiple highlighting themes"
git commit -m "docs: update README with syntax highlighting info"

# 2. Push all commits
git push origin main

# 3. Create minor release
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - Add syntax highlighting"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

### Scenario 3: Mistake in Last Commit (Not Pushed Yet)

```bash
# Oops, forgot to add a file
git add forgotten_file.zig
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Or fix the commit message
git commit --amend -m "fix: correct message"

# Note: Only do this if you haven't pushed yet!
```

### Scenario 4: Need to Fix a Released Version

```bash
# If you found a critical bug in v0.1.0 after release

# 1. Fix the bug
git commit -m "fix: critical security issue in input handling"

# 2. Create new patch release
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Release v0.1.1 - Security fix"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.1

# The old release stays, new release is now available
```

### Scenario 5: Want to Delete a Bad Tag

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.1.0

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0

# Or delete remote tag (alternative syntax)
git push origin --delete v0.1.0

# Note: Only do this if the release is very new and no one has downloaded it
# Generally, it's better to create a new patch version instead
```

### Scenario 6: See What Changed Since Last Release

```bash
# List tags
git tag

# Show changes since last tag
git log v0.1.0..HEAD --oneline

# Detailed view
git log v0.1.0..HEAD

# See diff
git diff v0.1.0..HEAD
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Common Commands

```bash
# Check status
git status

# See what changed
git diff

# Stage changes
git add <file>
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "message"

# Push
git push origin main

# Create tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"

# Push tag
git push origin v0.1.0

# List tags
git tag -l

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

### Emergency Undo Commands

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes) - DANGEROUS!
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Discard changes to a file
git checkout -- filename.zig

# Unstage a file
git reset HEAD filename.zig
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Commit often with clear messages
‚úÖ Test before pushing
‚úÖ Use semantic versioning
‚úÖ Write meaningful commit messages
‚úÖ Tag releases properly
‚úÖ Keep commits focused (one logical change per commit)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Commit broken code to `main`
‚ùå Use `git commit -m "wip"` or "fixed stuff"
‚ùå Push without testing
‚ùå Delete tags after people have downloaded them
‚ùå Commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
‚ùå Have giant commits with many unrelated changes

## Your First Release Walkthrough

Let's walk through creating your first public release:

```bash
# 1. Make sure everything is committed
git status
# Output: nothing to commit, working tree clean ‚úì

# 2. Test the build
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
./zig-out/bin/zodollama
# Manual testing: send a message, check markdown rendering, test scrolling ‚úì

# 3. Create the first release tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0 - Initial public release

Features:
- Real-time AI chat with Ollama
- Beautiful markdown rendering
- Non-blocking streaming
- Mouse support and scrolling
- Configurable colors and models
- Table rendering
- Emoji support"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main           # Push all commits
git push origin v0.1.0         # Push the tag

# 5. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Actions to build

# 6. Go to https://github.com/humanjesse/zodollama/releases
# You should see v0.1.0 with the binary attached!

# 7. Download the binary and test it
wget https://github.com/humanjesse/zodollama/releases/download/v0.1.0/zodollama-linux-x86_64
chmod +x zodollama-linux-x86_64
./zodollama-linux-x86_64

# 8. Done! üéâ Your project is now publicly released!
```

Remember: **It's okay to make mistakes!** Git is very forgiving, and you can almost always undo things. The most important thing is to learn and improve with each release.

Happy deploying! üöÄ
