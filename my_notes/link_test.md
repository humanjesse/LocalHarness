# Link Testing

Here are some test links:

This is [an example](http://example.com/) inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

Check out [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) for more information.

You can also visit [GitHub](https://github.com) for open source projects.

## Mixed Content

This paragraph has a [link](https://test.com) in the middle of some text. The link should be properly formatted with underlines and the URL should be visible.

- List item with [a link](https://item.com)
- Another item without links
- Third item with [multiple](https://one.com) [links](https://two.com)

> This blockquote contains [a link](https://quote.com) inside it.

That's all for testing!
